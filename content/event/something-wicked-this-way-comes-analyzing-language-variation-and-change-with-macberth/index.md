title: "Something wicked this way comes: Analyzing language variation and change
  with MacBERTh"

event: Dahlem Lectures in Linguistics
event_url: https://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/izeus/veranstaltungen/dahlemlectureslinguistics/index.html

location: Freie Universit√§t Berlin, Germany

summary: This presentation demonstrates how MacBERTh may help researchers to
  (i) access and (ii) analyse the functional-semantic information encoded in
  linguistic corpus data in a (semi-)automatic way. More specifically, after
  surveying the performance of the model on general downstream NLP tasks, we home
  in on a specific case study in morphosyntactic variation in English ing-forms.
