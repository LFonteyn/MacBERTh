title: Meaning-based querying of historical corpora with MacBERTh
abstract: >-
  This demonstration will focus on MacBERTh, a BERT-based model pre-trained on
  Early Modern and Late Modern English (3.9B (tokenized) words, time span:
  1450-1950; Manjavacas & Fonteyn 2021, 2022). We will demonstrate how MacBERTh
  may help researchers (i) access and (ii) analyse the semantic information
  encoded in linguistic corpus data in a (semi-)automatic way. Because the
  contextualized embeddings MacBERTh produces can be used to measure semantic
  ‘closeness’ between word/phrase/sentence tokens, they can be manipulated to
  enable semantic searches within textual material. By creating embeddings with
  MacBERTh, researchers will also be able to map out the distances

  between senses of linguistic items (in different texts and different time stages) as formalized in their representational distances. In this demonstration, we walk participants through case studies that show how MacBERTh can support historical corpus analysis (from data collection to pre-processing to (error) analysis).
