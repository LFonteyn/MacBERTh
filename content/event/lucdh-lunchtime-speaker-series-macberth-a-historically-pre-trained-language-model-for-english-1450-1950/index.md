title: "LUCDH Lunchtime Speaker Series: MacBERTh: A Historically Pre-Trained
  Language Model for English (1450-1950)"

event: LUCDH Lunch lecture
event_url: https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/events/2022/02/lucdh-lunchtime-speaker-series-fonteyn-manjavacas

location: P.J. Vethbuilding, room 1.07 (Digital Lab) & Online

summary: In this talk, Fonteyn and Manjavacas Arevalo present MacBERTh -- a transformer-based
  language model pre-trained on historical English -- and exhaustively assess
  its benefits on a large set of relevant downstream tasks. The experiments
  highlight that, despite some differences across target time periods,
  pre-training on historical language from scratch outperforms models
  pre-trained on present-day language and later adapted to historical language.
abstract: Researchers who interpret and analyse historical textual material are
  well-aware that languages are subject to change over time, and that the way in
  which concepts and discourses of class, gender, norms and prestige function in
  different time periods. As such, it is quite important that the interpretation
  of textual/linguistic material from the past is not approached from a
  present-day point-of-view, which is why NLP models pre-trained on present-day
  language data are less than ideal candidates for the job. In this talk,
  Fonteyn and Manjavacas Arevalo present MacBERTh -- a transformer-based
  language model pre-trained on historical English -- and exhaustively assess
  its benefits on a large set of relevant downstream tasks. Our experiments
  highlight that, despite some differences across target time periods,
  pre-training on historical language from scratch outperforms models
  pre-trained on present-day language and later adapted to historical language.
